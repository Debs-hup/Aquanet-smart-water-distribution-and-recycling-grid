# Aquanet-smart-water-distribution-and-recycling-grid
üéØProject Overview

Aquanet is a distributed smart water management system designed to help collect, monitor, and distribute water more efficiently in areas where is needed the most. The main idea is to build a network of connected devices that can gather water from different sources like rivers, boreholes, rainwater tanks, or underground wells and make it available in areas lacking this facility.

The project uses the distributed systems concept, that is control and decision-making don‚Äôt happen in one place. Also, the system is made up of several components that work together:
	‚Ä¢	Sensor nodes installed at water sources continuously measure things like water flow, pH, turbidity, and storage level.
	‚Ä¢	Edge controllers manage a group of nearby sources, process local data, and decide what to do for example, whether to send more water to storage or redirect it to another area.
	‚Ä¢	A cloud platform collects updates from all regions, analyzes the overall situation, and can send commands to balance supply and demand.
	‚Ä¢	Finally, distribution units carry out those commands by delivering water to communities in need, storage tanks, or treatment facilities.

With AquaNet, the goal is to create a flexible and reliable water grid that reacts in real time, reduces waste, and helps ensure fair access to clean water across different locations.

üíß Problem Statement

Many cities and rural areas still face serious problems when it comes to water distribution.
Some regions have plenty of water sources, while others lack this water resources with constant shortages. In several cases:
	‚Ä¢	Water systems are controlled manually, making it hard to react quickly to changes.
	‚Ä¢	Since there is no real-time monitoring, leaks, contamination, or low supply go unnoticed.
	‚Ä¢	Existing systems rely on centralized control if that central point fails, the whole network can be affected.
	‚Ä¢	Coordination between these different water sources and distribution points are missing.

These problems leads to significant water waste and some communities go without enough or no water, and maintaining the system becomes difficult. To manage water resources more effectively, a dispersed, automated and adaptive strategy is required for efficient distribution.

‚öôÔ∏è Solution Statement

AquaNet provides a practical solution by combining IoT technology and distributed computing.
The system will connect to multiple water sources, local controllers, and delivery units into one organized network.

Here is how it works:
	1.	Smart Source Nodes:
Using IoT sensors it collects water availability and quality data in real time and transmit it to adjacent edge controllers through lightweight communication (MQTT).
	2.	Edge Controllers:
Each edge unit manages local sources, processes data, and makes immediate decisions for instance, when to release water or when to store it for later use.
	3.	Cloud Platform:
It receives summarized data from each edge controller, monitors the overall health of the grid, and then send instructions to redistribute water between regions when one area runs low.
	4.	Distribution Units:
These units receives commands from the cloud to physically transport or reroute water where it is needed, while it continuously reports their status.

By distributing intelligence across the system, AquaNet avoids a single point of failure and make sure that if one part goes offline, the other one‚Äôs can still function. Over time, the collected data can also be used to predict shortages, detect contamination early, and plan future distribution more effectively.
